Architecture Refactoring

Keys to go through the next important step in the lifecyle of your application

Refactoring allow the code to evolve incrementally enabling the design of an application to adapt itself to its context, while the tests guaranty its functionnalities. It is necessary to continue to deliver value at the same pace with a growing code base. This is the kaizen of code.

By the way, the developpers are more and more working on aging software. To cope with an important need for scalability,  new features, or organization changes within a small amount of timei. You have to refactor the structure of your software, and at the same time keeping it chippable. You need radical changes. This is kaikaku. 

We will talk about how we inverted a dynamic call routing application from a kernel centric logic to a client/server voicexml architecture in one month, with 100 KLOC java. Or change all the home made statistic layer of a 160 java KLOC mobile video service with an AMQP broker, continuing to deliver other features with a 5M statistic events per day traffic.

We will explain : 
- how we identified the situations where incremental refactoring was not applicable
- the context for this breakthrough to happen
- the tools we used 
- the results of these changes, what did we learnt ?
- some patterns/anti-patterns (extract module, merge-extract module, branch by abstraction...)

We kept an empiric vision, test based, and teamwork based.

This session, presented by Bruno Thomas and Jean-Philippe Caruana will give yous some keys to go through the next important step in the lifecyle of your application.
